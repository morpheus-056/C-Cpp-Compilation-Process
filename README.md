# C-Cpp-Compilation-Process
This repository demonstrates the different stages of compilation in C/C++.
It breaks down the journey of a source file (.c/.cpp) into the following stages:

 Preprocessing – handling macros, header file inclusion, and conditional compilation.
 Compilation – translating preprocessed code into assembly language.
 Assembly – converting assembly code into machine-readable object code.
 Linking – combining object files and libraries into the final executable.

Each stage is explained with examples, commands, and outputs, making it easier to understand what happens behind the scenes when you build a C/C++ program.
